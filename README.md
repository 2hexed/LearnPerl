### In this repo I will be covering the main stuff in perl (like arrays, hashs, variables etc).

> # How do I use Variables?
+ ### In perl we can't just write the variable name and assign a value to it instead there is a special character which tells perl that "hey this is a variable".

> ## What Special Character is it and how do I use it?

+ #### In perl whilst defining a variable you need to use `$` before defining it.
__Usage__:
```perl
$age = 17; # Integer
$name = "Nick"; # String
$Salary = 1445.50; # Float
```
